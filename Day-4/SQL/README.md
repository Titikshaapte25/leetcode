# SQL Query for Combining Person and Address Information

## Description:

This SQL query retrieves a combined set of information about individuals, including their names, cities, and states of residence. It leverages a LEFT JOIN to ensure that all person records are included, even if they lack a corresponding address.

## Key Features:

Retrieves first name, last name, city, and state for each person.
Retains all person records, regardless of address availability.
Employs a LEFT JOIN for inclusive results.

## Breakdown:

1. SELECT Clause:
Specifies the desired columns: firstName, lastName, city, and state.

2. FROM Clause:
Identifies the primary table: Person (aliased as p).
Incorporates the Address table (aliased as a) via a LEFT JOIN.

3. ON Clause:
Establishes the joining condition: p.personId = a.personId.

## Output:

Produces a result set with the following columns:
firstName
lastName
city (may contain NULL for individuals without addresses)
state (may contain NULL for individuals without addresses)

## Additional Notes:
Consider potential NULL values in the city and state columns.
Adapt table and column names to match your specific database schema.
