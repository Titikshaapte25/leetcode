C++ Code for Palindrome Detection

This C++ code implements a function isPalindrome that determines whether a given integer x is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward, such as 121, 1001, or -9009.

Key Features:

Handles both positive and negative numbers (except overflow).
Efficiently reverses the integer using iterative calculation.
Provides clear test cases for demonstration.
How It Works:

isPalindrome Function:

Returns false if x is negative.
Initializes variables org to store the original x and rev to accumulate the reversed value.
Iterates while org is greater than 0:
Extracts the least significant digit using % 10.
Multiplies rev by 10 to shift existing digits left.
Adds the extracted digit to rev to build the reversed number.
Divides org by 10 to remove the processed digit.
Compares the original x and the reversed rev. If they are equal, x is a palindrome; otherwise, it's not.
Testing:

The runTestCases function takes a vector of integers as input.
Creates a Solution object to access the isPalindrome function.
Iterates through the test cases vector, calling isPalindrome for each value and printing the result.

Enhancements:

Overflow Handling: The current code might overflow for very large x values. Consider using safer data types like long long or BigNumber libraries.
Error Handling: The code assumes valid input. Add checks for invalid types or unexpected values (e.g., strings).
Edge Cases: Consider handling non-numeric inputs or empty test cases more gracefully.
Time and Space Complexity: Analyze the code's time and space complexity and optimize if necessary.
