#Palindrome Number Checker (C++)
This code implements a bool isPalindrome(int x) function that efficiently determines whether a given integer is a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., 1221, 101, etc.

##Key Features:

O(log n) time complexity for efficient number reversal
Handles negative numbers and single-digit numbers
Uses clear variable names and comments for readability

#How It Works:
Check if the number is negative, negative numbers cannot be palindromes.
Create two variables:
    org: stores the original number.
    rev: stores the reversed number built digit by digit.
While org is greater than 0:
Extract the last digit of org: org % 10.
Multiply rev by 10 to shift existing digits left.
Add the extracted digit to rev: rev = (10 * rev) + (org % 10).
Remove the last digit from org: org /= 10.
Compare the original number (x) and the reversed number (rev).
Return true if they are equal, false otherwise.

##Usage:
Include the necessary headers: <iostream> and <vector>.
Create a Solution object.
Call the isPalindrome(int x) method, passing the integer to be checked.
The method returns true if the number is a palindrome, false otherwise.

##Test Cases:
This code includes a runTestCases function that demonstrates usage and verifies the results for a few sample inputs.

##Additional Notes:
This solution uses integer arithmetic to reverse the number, avoiding potential string conversion overhead.
Consider expanding the test cases to cover more edge cases.
